# üé∂ SoundCloud to MP3

This script is an easy way to fetch an mp3 file from a given SoundCloud URL.

‚úÖ Run `make` to get started automatically or choose one of the following recipes:

- ‚ú® `make init:` install dependencies (If you're not running linux, you will have to download **ffmpeg** manually)
- ‚ú® `make run:` execute script
- ‚ú® `make clean:` remove downloaded files

‚úÖ To download a specific url, add a `u` variable like so:

```sh
make run u=https://soundcloud.com/achmad-husnul-qowim/unicorn-by-hiroyuki-sawano
```
